# OpenAI-Challenge
Submission for Shopify's Developer Challenge

This project fetches from openAI's API and returns AI generated text onto the page in real-time.

Didnt have a way to throw up a quick back-end, apologies for the key format.

If request is broken its because of OpenAI revoking my Key. I don't have the money to host my own backend at the moment. Ill work on a solution tomorrow, 5/14/2022, sorry.
